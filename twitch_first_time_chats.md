        [03:25:43] NebulaNubTTV: I thought this was a pretty underwhelming title compared to House of Ashes. The fakeout ending and the actual ending was pretty abrupt and underwhelming, at least in my playthrough where everyone survived. Plus the teenage voice lines were pretty cringy. In House of Ashes, at the end, anybody could die if you messed up the QTE so it was tense but this one was so underwhelming. Plus this credits scene is way too long.
